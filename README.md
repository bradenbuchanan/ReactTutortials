# ReactTutortials
This repository serves as a collection of projects and code snippets created while following along with various React and Next.js tutorials from popular online resources. The primary goal of this repo is to enhance my understanding of full-stack development by practicing and implementing the concepts learned through these tutorials.

## Learning Resources

The tutorials and video series I plan to follow include, but are not limited to:

- [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/) (YouTube channel)
- [Lamadev](https://www.youtube.com/@LamaDevWeb) (YouTube channel)
- [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@JavaScriptMastery) (YouTube channel)

I will also explore other reputable sources that provide high-quality tutorials and learning materials for React, Next.js, and related technologies.

## Project Structure

Each tutorial or project will be organized in its own folder within this repository. The folder structure will be as follows:
```
ReactTutorials/
├── tutorial-1/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src/
│   └── ...
├── tutorial-2/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src/
│   └── ...
├── ...
└── README.md
```

Each tutorial folder will contain a `README.md` file with details about the specific tutorial, such as the source, topics covered, and any additional notes or resources.
